- to unistall npm package like uuid: npm unistall uuid
- to install passport and jwt packages: npm install @nest/jwt @nset/passport passport passport-jwt
- to apply configuratio we need to run npm install config and npm install -g win-node-env (config use env variable) 
  configuration expects a config folder at root of application with some file in it
- for each env we can define a yaml/json/xml, ... files
- sensitive info is better to picked up from environment variable config and not code base (files in config folder)
- config package user NODE_END to define which environment (development, production, ...) we are in. if that
  file does not exists the environment is development and it user file with development name to pick configs
- for config, default.yaml file is available in different environment and will be overriden by other files in 
  different environment
- before deployment we need to make 2 changes in package.json
  1) change start:prod to "start:prod": "NODE_ENV=production node dist/main"
  2) copy 4 dependencies from devDependencies to dependencies as some clould providers install packages from production dependecies not devDependencies 

- VERY IMPORTANT: in order to deploy to Amazon elastic beanstalk, we need to add a Procfile and the specified command in it.
- use npm run build to build the front-end app
- git remote add origin --gitUrl // this command add all files from local repository to remote repository on GitHub
  we need to call git push origin master (asks for credentials)
